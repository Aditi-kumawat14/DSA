## Introduction

In this repository, you will find implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science and software development. The goal is to provide clear, concise, and efficient implementations, along with explanations of their functionality and usage.

## Data Structures

- [Array](link_to_array_implementation)
- [Linked List](link_to_linked_list_implementation)
- [Stack](link_to_stack_implementation)
- [Queue](link_to_queue_implementation)
- [Tree](link_to_tree_implementation)
- [Graph](link_to_graph_implementation)
- [Hash Table](link_to_hash_table_implementation)
- [Heap](link_to_heap_implementation)

Each data structure includes its implementation along with explanations of its operations, time complexity analysis, and example usage.

## Algorithms

- [Sorting Algorithms](link_to_sorting_algorithms)
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - etc.
- [Search Algorithms](link_to_search_algorithms)
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - etc.
- [Graph Algorithms](link_to_graph_algorithms)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
  - etc.
- [Dynamic Programming](link_to_dynamic_programming)
  - Fibonacci Series
  - Longest Common Subsequence
  - Knapsack Problem
  - etc.
- [etc.]

Each algorithm includes its implementation along with explanations of its approach, time complexity analysis, and example usage.

## Usage

To use the implementations in your projects, you can simply copy the relevant files into your project directory and import them as needed. Each implementation is self-contained and can be used independently.
